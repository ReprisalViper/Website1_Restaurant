      <p>Founded in 2021 by Emma and Nate, The Green Spoon began as a mission-driven restaurant to bring delicious, healthy food to the Barrie community. Our meals are made fresh daily with locally-sourced ingredients and tailored for every diet—from paleo to plant-based.</p>
      <p>We believe food should be both nourishing and kind to the planet. That’s why we compost, minimize waste, and partner with nearby farms.</p>
